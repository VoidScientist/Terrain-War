# Terrain War

## About the game

This is a local 2 player game where players fight to get the biggest area of the map.

Winning can be achieved by isolating areas from the enemy and gaining every cell it contains.

The game was made using Godot 3.5

## Modes

- Play
- Map Creation

## How it works

The game is based on a single algorithm: flood fill

It uses it in ways that are different from what normal flood fill is used for, but that's the basis behind its algorithm.

## State of the game

The game is actually on hold.

I have worked a lot on it recently, and I believe it has every functionality it should.

If there are bugs then I'll fix them, but I believe I am finished.

The reason being: it would need a lot of refactor to be maintanable again.
